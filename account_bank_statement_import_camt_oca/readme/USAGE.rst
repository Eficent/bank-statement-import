#. Go to the Accounting Dashboard, to the specific bank journal and press Import.
#. Select the SEPA CAMT053 file and import it. Press "UPLOAD".
#. A new bank statement will be created, that will include all the transactions that have been imported.

If you have a SEPA CAMT054 file that provides additional information to the CAMT053, you can follow the same
steps as above, and the application will update the previously imported transactions, updating the fields 'Label'
and the partner name.

Sometimes companies will only import the CAMT054 as a standalone file (not related with a CAMT053 file).
In this case a new statement will be created.

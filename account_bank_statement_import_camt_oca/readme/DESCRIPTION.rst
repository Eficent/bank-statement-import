Module to import SEPA CAMT.053 and CAMT.054 Format bank statement files.

CAMT053 and CAMT054 are two XML-based message types used in financial messaging
between banks and their customers.

CAMT053 is used for reporting of account statements, while CAMT054 is used for reporting of
individual transactions.

In combination, CAMT053 and CAMT054 can be used to provide a complete picture of a bank account's activity.
CAMT053 can be used to provide a statement of account balances and transactions for a specific period,
while CAMT054 can be used to provide detailed information about each individual transaction within that period.

For example, a bank may provide a CAMT053 message to their customer at the end of the month,
which includes the balance and summary of all transactions for the month. If the customer wants more detailed
information on a specific transaction, they can request a CAMT054 message for that transaction, which provides
details such as the date, amount, currency, and reference information.

Using CAMT053 and CAMT054 together can provide a more comprehensive view of a bank account's activity,
allowing customers to track their finances more effectively and make informed decisions.
